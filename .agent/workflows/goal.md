# /goal — Set Your Tele's Goal

Every tele has ONE goal. Everything it says, shows, and does drives toward that goal.

## What Makes a Good Goal?

A goal is **one clear action** you want users to take.

**Good goals:**
- Get users to sign up for the Launch Event
- Get users to book a demo
- Get users to start the 30-day challenge
- Get users to schedule a consultation
- Get users to download the app

**Bad goals:**
- "Get users to learn about us" — too vague, not an action
- "Get users to engage" — what does that mean?
- "Get users to sign up AND buy AND refer" — that's three goals, pick one

## How to Set

Tell the Build Agent your goal:
- "My goal is to get parents to sign up for the 30-day manners program"

The Build Agent will:
1. Update the goal in `tele-knowledge.md`
2. Update CTAs in the welcome experience
3. Update the highlighted nav item
4. Make sure shot prompts guide toward this goal

## After Setting

1. `/journey` — Define the steps users take to reach the goal
2. `/check` — Verify alignment
3. `/publish` — Push live
