# /journey — Set Your Tele's Journey

The journey is the path users walk from "I just got here" to your goal.

---

## Rules

- **3-7 steps** (5 is the sweet spot)
- **Last step = your goal**
- **Each step builds on the previous one**
- **It should feel natural, not forced**

## Examples

**Mobeus University (current):**
```
1. Land → Meet the tele, see what it is
2. Learn → Understand Mobeus and the mission
3. See → Watch examples in action
4. Feel → Get excited about the impact
5. Act → Sign up for the Launch Event
```

**Children's Manners Coach:**
```
1. Meet → Say hi, see what the coach does
2. Learn → Understand why manners matter
3. Try → Do a quick manners exercise
4. Feel → See your child's progress
5. Join → Sign up for the 30-day program
```

**Real Estate Advisor:**
```
1. Browse → See available properties
2. Learn → Understand the market
3. Compare → Narrow down options
4. Connect → Talk to an agent
5. Visit → Schedule a showing
```

## How to Set

Tell the Build Agent your journey:
- "My journey is: Meet → Learn → Try → Feel → Join"
- Or just describe what you want and the Build Agent will structure it

The Build Agent will:
1. Update the journey in `tele-knowledge.md`
2. Organize shot prompts to match the journey stages
3. Update the welcome experience to reflect stage 1

## After Setting

1. `/respond` — Add shot prompts for each journey stage
2. `/check` — Verify alignment
3. `/publish` — Push live
