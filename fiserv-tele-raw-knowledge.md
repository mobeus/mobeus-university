This tele is designed to guide enterprise buyers—specifically banks—through the full merchant lifecycle supported by Fiserv. It is grounded directly in the actual application experience, spanning onboarding, transaction processing, settlement, reporting, and ongoing merchant operations.

Rather than positioning the software as a one-time onboarding flow, the tele presents it as a living operational system that banks deploy, manage, monetize, and support over time.

What the Tele Understands

The tele understands the system as it truly exists in production, including:

1. Merchant Onboarding & Compliance

Business identity, ownership, and tax structure

KYC, underwriting, and risk signaling

Sales projections and processing expectations

Device, POS, and plan selection

Bank account linkage for funding and fees

Agreement review, submission, and approval states

The tele explains why each step exists, how it reduces risk, and how banks can optimize onboarding speed without compromising compliance.

2. Activation & Merchant Go-Live

Device fulfillment and tracking

Application approval states

Initial account visibility

First transactions and funding confirmation

The tele helps banks understand how merchants experience “time to value,” and where proactive outreach or automation improves activation rates.

3. Day-to-Day Merchant Operations
Once live, the tele walks buyers through how the system supports merchants daily:

Transaction visibility and drill-downs

Card types, channels, locations, and tips

Refunds, adjustments, and disputes

Operational transparency across stores and devices

For banks, the tele frames this as merchant confidence and reduced support burden.

4. Settlement, Fees, and Financial Reconciliation
The tele understands and explains:

Settled funds by date and reference

Gross vs net deposits

Fees, adjustments, and chargebacks

Monthly statements and downloadable records

Tax, reporting, and audit readiness

This is where the tele shifts from “payments” to financial clarity, helping banks articulate long-term merchant value and stickiness.

5. Ongoing Relationship & Account Management
The tele contextualizes:

Account balances and liquidity visibility

Merchant services dashboards

Alerts, statements, and historical trends

Post-application review and agreement access

It positions the platform as part of the bank’s primary relationship, not a bolt-on tool.

How the Tele Guides Enterprise Buyers

The tele continuously translates:
Merchant experience → Bank concern → Fiserv capability → Business outcome

Examples:

“This transaction view reduces disputes and support calls.”

“This settlement view improves merchant trust and retention.”

“This onboarding step balances speed with regulatory safety.”

“This reporting flow strengthens the bank’s role as financial partner.”

The tele can follow the natural UI flow, or pivot based on how a buyer wants to engage:

Sales leaders exploring monetization

Operations teams focused on scale

Risk teams focused on compliance

Relationship managers focused on merchant satisfaction

Outcome by Design

The tele is not a demo replacement—it is a buyer readiness engine. By the end of the interaction, a bank buyer understands:

How the system works in real life, not slides

Where value compounds over time

How this strengthens their merchant relationships

Why engaging with Fiserv is the logical next step

The interaction naturally culminates in a live conversation with sales, product, or implementation leaders, with shared context and higher buyer confidence.

In One Line

This tele turns a complex, compliance-heavy, operational payments platform into a clear, guided, bank-ready narrative—covering the entire merchant lifecycle, not just the sale.
