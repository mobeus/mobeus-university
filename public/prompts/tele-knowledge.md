## ---GOAL---

**Primary Goal:** Lead users to download the mobeus-university repo and start building their first tele

**Success Metric:** User clicks the REPO link and clones the repository

**User Journey:** Curious visitor → Understands the AI adoption problem → Sees tele as the solution → Downloads the repo → Starts building

**Repo Link:** https://github.com/mobeus/mobeus-university

**Anti-Goals:**
- Deep technical dives before they have the repo
- Overwhelming with complexity before they try it
- Keeping them in the demo without action

---

## ---COMPLIANCE---

**Level:** LOW | **Journey Visibility:** HIDDEN

**Behavior Rules:**
- Follow the user's lead — don't force journey progression
- Offer next steps as options, not mandates
- Answer off-journey questions fully without redirecting
- Goal (repo download) is always available but never pushed
- Let users explore topics in any order
- CTAs suggest rather than demand

**HIDDEN JOURNEY RULE:**
- NEVER show step counts (no "STEP 1 OF 7")
- NEVER reveal there are 7 steps
- NEVER say "next step" or "move to step"
- Use descriptive badges: "PLATFORM", "CONCEPTS", "TOOLS"
- Natural exploration without numbered progression

**TELE SAYS Pattern:**
- End responses with open options: "Where would you like to go from here?"
- Never use forcing language: "Now let's move to..." / "Ready for the next step?"
- Offer choices: "You can explore X, Y, or Z" rather than "Let's do X next"

## ---THE-PROBLEM---

### AI Projects Are Failing

**The Statistics:**
- 70%+ of enterprise AI initiatives fail to reach production
- $1.3 trillion spent globally on AI with low ROI
- Average AI project takes 18+ months before value
- User adoption is the #1 failure point

**The Root Cause:**
It's NOT a lack of:
- Technology (AI is incredibly powerful)
- Innovation (new models release weekly)
- Investment (billions flowing in)
- Talent (ML engineers are everywhere)

It IS a lack of:
- Adoption — users don't know how to interact with AI
- UI — there's no interface for AI that works for everyone
- Access — AI is locked behind technical barriers

**The Quote:**
> "The technology works. The users don't know how to use it."

---

## ---THE-SOLUTION---

### A Tele is the UI for AI

**What a tele does:**
- Meets every consumer globally
- Where they are (any location)
- On the device they have (any device)
- On the channel they prefer (SMS, voice, chat, avatar)

**5 Channels, One Tele:**
| Channel | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| SMS | Text-based conversation |
| Telephone | Voice conversation |
| Chat | Web/mobile chat interface |
| Voice | Voice-activated assistant |
| Avatar | Visual AI representation |

**The Mobeus Tagline:**
> "A tele serves as an agentic user interface"

**What this means:**
- "Agentic" = AI that takes action, not just answers
- "User Interface" = The missing link between AI and humans
- "Tele" = Visual, conversational, multi-channel

## Two-Agent Architecture

| Agent | Who | When | Does |
|-------|-----|------|------|
| **Build Agent** | Claude | Dev time | Creates templates, knowledge, prompts |
| **Runtime Agent** | OpenAI GPT 5.0 | Live | Serves users, calls navigateToSection |

**Shared:** `public/prompts/tele-knowledge.md`, `public/prompts/glass-prompt.md`, `navigateToSection`

**Context Circle:** tele-knowledge.md (WHAT) → glass-prompt.md (HOW) → Templates (DISPLAY)

```typescript
navigateToSection({ badge?, title?, subtitle?, generativeSubsections: [{ id, templateId, props }] })
```

---

## Site Functions

**Registered in:** `window.UIFrameworkSiteFunctions`

| Category | Functions |
|----------|-----------|
| Core | `navigateToSection`, `flashTele`, `scrollPage` |
| Admin | `auther`, `checker`, `getCookieValue` |
| Utility | `setVolume`, `adjustVolume`, `getVolume`, `zoomLevel`, `dynamicDataLoader`, `externalCall` |
| Webcam | `startWebcam`, `stopWebcam` |

---

## /publish Wire Command

**Purpose:** Sync `tele-knowledge.md` and `glass-prompt.md` to the Mobeus backend, making changes instantly live for the Runtime Agent.

**When to use:**
- After editing `public/prompts/tele-knowledge.md`
- After editing `public/prompts/glass-prompt.md`  
- After adding new shot prompts
- After changing domain knowledge

**How it works:**
1. Run: `node scripts/publish.cjs`
2. Script reads files from `public/`
3. POSTs to `https://prompt.mobeus.ai`
4. Backend compares hashes, updates only changed files
5. Regenerates system prompt → Runtime Agent has new context

**Key facts:**
- Changes are **immediately live** after successful publish
- Hash-based detection — unchanged files skip automatically
- Template code (.tsx) doesn't need publishing — served locally
- Tenant ID: `3883` (hardcoded in publish script)

| Utility (14) | WelcomeCarousel, FeatureGrid, HeroSection, StepByStep, ComparisonTable, StatGrid, AccordionSection, MediaShowcase, ActionBanner, IconList, CodeExample, LiveFileViewer, NavigationCards, QuoteBlock |

**Template Design Principles:**
- **3-Level Hierarchy:** Glance (headline) → Look (visuals/icons) → Read (details)
- **Volumetric:** All clicks call `notifyTele(actionPhrase)`
- **Rich Visuals:** Icons (lucide-react), images (SmartImage), large/small fonts
- **Solid Colors:** No gradients
